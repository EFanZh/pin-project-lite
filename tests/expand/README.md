# Expansion tests

Similar to ui tests, but instead of checking the compiler output, this checks the code generated by macros.

See [examples](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project/tree/master/examples) for descriptions of what the generated code does, and why it needs to be generated.

[*Note that the way of updating the generated code is different than trybuild.*](https://docs.rs/macrotest/1/macrotest/#updating-expandedrs)
