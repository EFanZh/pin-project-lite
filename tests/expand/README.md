# Expansion tests

Similar to ui tests, but instead of checking the compiler output, this checks the code generated by macros.

To run this test, run the following command:

```sh
bash scripts/expandtest.sh
```

Or if you want to run all the tests that include expandtest:

```sh
bash scripts/ci.sh
```

See [examples](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project/tree/master/examples) for descriptions of what the generated code does, and why it needs to be generated.
