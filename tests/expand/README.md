# Expansion tests

Similar to ui tests, but instead of checking the compiler output, this checks the code generated by macros.

See [examples](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project/tree/master/examples) for descriptions of what the generated code does, and why it needs to be generated.

To run this test, use [`scripts/expandtest.sh`](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project-lite/blob/master/scripts/expandtest.sh) or [`scripts/ci.sh`](https://github.com/taiki-e/pin-project-lite/blob/master/scripts/ci.sh).
